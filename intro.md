Hello, my name is...
We started a project to publish Ads...
Facebook
Top-down, sequential workflows
Then state-machine:
https://github.roving.com/ruby/facebook-ads-adapter/blob/e241cbf5600bdd4f29dcb7a2de88f9c6f5be0178/app/models/ad.rb
got ugly
https://github.roving.com/ruby/facebook-ads-adapter/blob/0c22d6356ddba11427950934782804462d4c9d9a/app/models/ad.rb

Need something better
Promise syntax look nice
What are Promises

History
Goal
State of Promises
How we began using it
Why we like it
How we'd like to use it in the future
Cool shit you can do with Promises
Looking forward to the world of multi-step processes in api interactions
