We all get what is happening here, but it doesn't look anything like the way we think about it
Wouldn't it be nice to see these sequential flows the way we think about them

Imagine if you didn't want to block; imagine if some steps could run concurrently

The promises constructor exposes the fulfill and reject methods (of the promise instance)
to the passed block.
